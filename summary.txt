The topic for a presentation is summarized teams meeting. PRUTHVIRAJ Patil, Adil KHATRI, HARSH CHOTALIYA, SHUBHAM KANOJIYA and Adil are the team members. They have to find out the total number of attendees in the meeting, the duration of the meeting just with the help of the transcript they have generated from the Microsoft Teams. They used a sequence to sequence model.  The summary is generated by the Microsoft Teams. It's a summary which is making sense to the users because it's the only or the topic which have been discussed by the three users of the meeting. The summary could be used further to get the number of attendees, the duration of the meat and the total number of active attendees. It will also implement the downloadable feature so that the user can download the transcript, active attendees and the duration.
